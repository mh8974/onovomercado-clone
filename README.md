# O Novo Mercado - Website Clone

This is a clone of the O Novo Mercado website (https://onovomercado.com), created as a static HTML/CSS/JavaScript implementation.

## Project Structure

```
onovomercado-clone/
├── index.html         # Main HTML file
├── styles.css        # CSS styles
├── script.js         # JavaScript functionality
└── images/           # Images directory
```

## Features

- Responsive design that works on desktop and mobile devices
- Interactive elements including forms and mobile navigation
- Styled to match the original website's appearance

## Running the Website

Since this is a static website, you can simply open the `index.html` file in any web browser to view it. Alternatively, you can use a local development server to serve the files.

### Using Python's built-in HTTP server

If you have Python installed, you can run a simple HTTP server:

```bash
# For Python 3.x
python3 -m http.server

# For Python 2.x
python -m SimpleHTTPServer
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8000`.

### Using Node.js

If you have Node.js installed, you can use packages like `http-server`:

```bash
# Install http-server globally
npm install -g http-server

# Run the server
http-server
```

Then open your browser and navigate to `http://localhost:8080`.

## Note About Images

This clone uses placeholder images where necessary. For a complete clone with all original images, you would need to download and include all images from the original website, respecting their copyright and usage rights.
